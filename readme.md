## Primitive Data Types: 
Primitive datatype is pre defined by the programming language The size and type of variable values are specified, and it has no additional methods
* primitive values are immutable.
* Primitives are stored by value.
## Non primitive types:
These data types types are not actually defined by the programming language 
* Non-primitive values are mutable.
* Non-Primitive (objects) are stored by reference.
### Number:
number datatype in javascript can hold the decimal values as well as non decimal values
* Possible Values : -1 | 3 | 3.42 | 9.66e | Infinity | - Infinity | NaN

### String:
string is the sequence of one or more characters that may be numbers,letters, symbols 
* Possible Values : "text" | 'text' | `text` | `javascript is "brain" of html`

### Boolean:
Boolean types can only accept the two type true and false.
* If the value is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false. 
* All other values, including any object, an empty array ([]), or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.
* Possible Values : true | false 

### null:
This datatype can hold the only one possible values that is null
* The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
* typeof(boolean) : "object"

### Undefined:
Undefined is a type of its own. It’s not an object. Just a value JavaScript will use when you named a variable but don’t assign a value to it. Your hoisted variables will also be automatically assigned a value of undefined.
* typeof(boolean) : "undefined"  

### Symbol:
Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.

## Non Primitive:
* JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
* Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas
